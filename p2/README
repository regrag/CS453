Make and Usage
--------------
cd into the version 1 dir and run make. This will compile the c and java version of webstats. In the ms_windows folder, the cpp file is located. This will need to be put into a visual studio project and then run.

Usage: webstats <[file names]>

Linux:
	Single Threaded on access_log00-07:
		real 0m14.637s
		user 0m13.380s
		sys 0m0.341s
	Multithreaded:
		real 0m12.618s
		user 0m18.083s
		sys 0m5.963s

Java:
	Single Threaded on access_log00-07:
		real 0m10.753s
		user 0m10.701s
		sys 0m0.430s
	Multithreaded:
		real 0m6.760s
		user 0m11.346s
		sys 0m0.697s

The times inproved for the multithreaded versions as expected. I image the reason for the large times is the fact that I do alot of locking and unlocking and did not optimize the program. Also, I ran this on a 3 year old computer with a dual core processor. It would run faster on newer computers that contain 4+ cores.

The hardest part of this project for me was getting the vs file to accept in the arguments that pointed to the data sources. I ended up wrapping the paths in "" and it finally worked (spaces in dir names suck!). Other than that, I felt like the project was manageable and doable in the amount of time given.
