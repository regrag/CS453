Programming Assignment 1

Usage: ./run.sh

mydash is a shell program written in C that uses a doubly linked list structure to keep track of jobs. The program runs most normal commands that a bash shell has like ls, cd, ps, etc. Also, there is a custom command, jobs, that will print all of the jobs that have been running in the background that have now been completed.

The design for this program was to write up the entire program in a single file and then break it up. Normally this design is poor to use, but I did not see the design section of the requirements until I was already partly through the project. When the shell was mostly completed, I then found sections that had common functionality and I broke those into functions and put them in a separate file.
