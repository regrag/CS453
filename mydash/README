Programming Assignment 1

Usage: ./run.sh

Test: ./mydashTest.sh

mydash is a shell program written in C that uses a doubly linked list structure to keep track of jobs. The program runs most normal commands that a bash shell has like ls, cd, ps, etc. Also, there is a custom command, jobs, that will print all of the jobs that have been running in the background or have completed.

The design for this program was to write up the entire program in a single file and then break it up. Normally this design is poor to use, but I did not see the design section of the requirements until I was already partly through the project. When the shell was mostly completed, I then found sections that had common functionality and I broke those into functions and put them in a separate file. This proved to be quite difficult and made things hard to read. If only Software Engineering was earlier in the program!

--UPDATED SECTION--

Now that I have received a poor grade for mydash, I am fixing my many mistakes for the buddy project. I have noticed that the "put it all in one file" method has really kicked me in the rear because coming back to a project I haven't touched in a few months and having to fix bugs has been a hasle. To fix my mistakes, I had to do do the following:
-Update this README
-Create a test script
-Include a version command
-fix the jobs command
-fix the job workflow so simple job control was completed
-a couple of other little things

In addition to my above comments, I would add one more. That is, I have grown greatly in my experience in both programming and Software Engineering in the last few months. I currently work at a Software Company and it has helped me develope critical thinking skills that I now find very useful and applicable to this school project.
