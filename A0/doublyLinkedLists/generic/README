First run the make command to compile the program (only if you did not run make in the root).

Usage: TestList <list size> [<test size=list size>] [<seed>]

The list data structure will accept any time of objects as data for the nodes. The requirements are:
1. The objects must have a key generation method.
2. The objects must have a toString method.
3. The objects must have a free memory method.

All three of these functions are passed into the list as pointers upon its creation. There is a fourth
require method that allows deeper comparison of objects. It is also required to be passed to the
constructor of the list.
