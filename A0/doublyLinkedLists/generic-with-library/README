This folder contains two sub directories.

The first, generic, contains files for a generic doubly linked list which can be compiled and then the
test can be run. The second, generic with library, contains files for a generic doubly linked list 
that can be compiled into a library.

Usage: make
Then cd into the directory you want. See inner README for usage of each.
